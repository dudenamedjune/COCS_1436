// A can hold 3.78 liters of milk. Each morning, a dairy farm ships cartons of milk to a local grocery store. The cost of producing one liter of milk is $0.38, and the profit of each carton of milk is $0.27. Write a program that does the following:
// a.    Prompts the user to enter the total amount of milk produced in the morning.
// b.    Outputs the number of milk cartons needed to hold milk. (Round your answer to the nearest integer.)
// c.    Outputs the cost of producing milk.

// d.    Outputs the profit for producing milk.
