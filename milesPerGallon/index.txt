//  Write a program that calculates a carâ€™s gas mileage. The program should ask the user to enter the number of gallons of gas the car can hold, and the number of miles it can be driven on a full tank. It should then display the number of miles that may be driven per gallon of gas.

print("Enter the number of gallons of gas your car holds:")
let galsOfGas = (Double)(readLine()!)
print("Enter the number of miles it can drive on a full tank:")
let numMilesOnFull = (Double)(readLine()!)
let mpg = numMilesOnFull! / galsOfGas!
print("MPG: ", (mpg))
