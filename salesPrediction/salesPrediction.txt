//The East Coast sales division of a company generates 58 percent of total sales. Based on that percentage, write a program that will predict how much the East Coast division will generate if the company has $8.6 million in sales this year.

let precentageOfSales = 0.58;
let companySales = 8.6e6;
let predictedSales = companySales * precentageOfSales;
