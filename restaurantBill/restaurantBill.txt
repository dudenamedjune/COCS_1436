// Write a program that computes the tax and tip on a restaurant bill for a patron with an $88.67 meal charge. The tax should be 6.75 percent of the meal cost. The tip should be 20 percent of the total after adding the tax. Display the meal cost, tax amount, tip amount, and total bill on the screen.

let TOTAL_WITHOUT_TIP = TAX_AMOUNT + MEAL_CHARGE
let TIP_AMOUNT = TOTAL_WITHOUT_TIP * TIP_PERCENTAGE
let TOTAL = TIP_AMOUNT + TOTAL_WITHOUT_TIP
print("Cost: $\(MEAL_CHARGE)")
print("Tax Amount: $\(TAX_AMOUNT)")
