// Write a program that asks the user for the number of males and the number of females registered in a class. The program should display the percentage of males and females in the class. Hint: Suppose there are 8 males and 12 females in a class. There are 20 students in the class. The percentage of males can be calculated as 8 รท 20 = 0.4, or 40 percent. The percentage of females can be calculated as 12 รท 20 = 0.6, or 60 percent.

print("How many males are in your class?")
let numMales = (Double)(readLine()!)
print("How many females are in your class?")
let numFemales = (Double)(readLine()!)
let total = numMales! + numFemales!
let precentageOfMales = (numMales! / total) * 100
let precentageOfFemales = (numFemales! / total) * 100
print("The class contains \(Int(precentageOfMales))% males and \(Int(precentageOfFemales))% females")
