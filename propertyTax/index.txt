//  A county collects property taxes on the assessed value of the property, which is 60 percent of the property’s actual value. If an acre of land is valued at $10,000, its assessed value is $6,000. The property tax is then 75¢ for each $100 of the assessed value. The tax for the acre assessed at $6,000 will be $45. Write a program that asks for the actual value of a piece of property, then displays the assessment value and property tax.
print("Enter Property value:")
let actualValueOfProperty = (Int)(readLine()!)
let assessedValue = Double(actualValueOfProperty!) * 0.6
let tax = (assessedValue / 100.00) * 0.75
print("Tax: $\(Int(tax)) Assessment: $\(Int(assessedValue))")
